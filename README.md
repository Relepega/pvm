# How to use

This is a CLI application, so you need to open a terminal and use it from there.

## Install

At the moment it is available only as a portable version and the installation process is not too complex:

1. Download the latest version [from here](https://github.com/Relepega/PythonVersionManager/releases).
2. Unzip the app where you won't move it never again until you uninstall it.
3. Inside the app folder, go to the subfolder `scripts`, right-click on `install.bat` and then click on `Run as administrator`. If the UAC kicks in, please click on `yes`.
4. Wait until you don't see any flying terminal and then close the folder.
5. Restart your terminal.
6. Type `pvm -h` and press enter. If the installation was successful then you will see an output like in [this image](#python-version-manager).
7. Profit ðŸŽ‰!

Please keep in mind that you must install the app for each user you want to use it with. 

## Uninstall

It's basically the same process as the installation one:

1. Open the app folder.
2. Go to the `scripts` subfolder, right-click on `uninstall.bat` and then click on `Run as administrator`. If the UAC kicks in, please click on `yes`.
3. Wait until you don't see any flying terminal and then close the folder.
4. Restart your terminal.
5. Type `pvm -h` and press enter. If pvm was uninstalled successfully now in the terminal you should see an error.
6. Profit ðŸŽ‰!
7. (optional) Please let me know why you decided to uninstall pvm: fill [this form](https://github.com/Relepega/PythonVersionManager/issues/new) and i'll be here to read your struggles with pvm.

Please keep in mind that you must uninstall the app for each user you want to use it with.

# FAQ

Q: Why reinvent the wheel when [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) exists and does the same thing?

A: Forgive my ignorance, but i didn't know of its existence until the creation of this project.
